# GENAI-KNOWLEDGE-HUB
A comprehensive toolkit for working with various databases and knowledge graph implementations, featuring integrations with AstraDB, MongoDB, and web crawling capabilities.

# 🌟 Features


**Web Crawling**

- Graph-based HAL (Hypertext Application Language) scraping
- Automated data extraction and processing

**Knowledge Graphs**

- Healthcare-specific langchain implementation
- Customizable graph structures for domain-specific applications


**MongoDB Integration**

- Basic MongoDB operations and RAG implementation
- Pinecone integration with real-time RAG pipeline
- Two-phase pipeline implementation for enhanced performance

**AstraDB RAG Integration**

- Implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with AstraDB
- Optimized stack operations for efficient data retrieval


# 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- AstraDB account and credentials
- MongoDB installation
- Pinecone API access
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)
